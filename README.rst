``bond`` -- MongoDB Artifact Download API Utility
=================================================

MongoDB publishes data feeds regarding all publically available versions. Bond
is a library for interacting with this data and for downloading different
versions of MongoDB primarily targeted at using MongoDB in various testing and
integration workflows.  

While the data provided by the API is stable, there has been some evolution of
the naming and content of MongoDB release artifacts over time, and there may
be some cases that bond may handle incorrectly as a result. Please feel free
to create issues if you encounter problems or would like to add a feature.

Bond is available for use under the terms of the Apache License (v2). Please
see the `godoc for complete API documentation and examples
